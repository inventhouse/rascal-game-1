Rascal
======

_First version of AI-developed Rascal game_

Prompt
------
Rascal is a solitaire card game, more details and rules are in @Rules.md.  We want to build a web app for it; a single-page mobile-optimized app that could be served statically and ideally playable offline.  Let's start simple with just the setup, gameplay, and special rules, but no options for changing the balance.  We can use the unicode card characters to avoid needing additional assets, but we should use font colors to distinguish red and black suits.  Also for simplicity, let's just use heart characters for the life counter (though the high reds should still be absent from the deck).  Use modern javascript best-practices, and ask if you have any questions about the game or implementation.
